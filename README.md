# Clean Architecture MVC with .NET 6.0 + SQLServer
> Using MVC project in Presentation layer.

This project is inspired in [Clean Architecture Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/clean-architecture-essencial-asp-net-core-com-c/) by [José Macoratti](https://www.macoratti.net/). But I implemented my version of SQLServer in a container, and personalized unit tests, using mock builders.

## Entity Framework Migrations
Execute migrations (Nuget package manager console)
```sh
update-database
```
